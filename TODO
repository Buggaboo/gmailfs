TODO 05-08-2010
- create git branches (git checkout -b newbranch)
  * master, original, this will be synched with git://git.sr71.net/gmailfs.git
  * cpython, minor alteration from git clone git://git.sr71.net/gmailfs.git
  * stackless, redo system threads using green threads
  * jit, like the cpython branch but with specific import alterations to allow use of imaplib and fuse wrapper
  * dokan, cpython branch but instead of fuse, dokan, for windows only
- refactor to seperate gmail behaviour policy; basic imap to fuse translation
  * define policy code
  * define baseline behaviour code
- refactor original code in cpython; submit to owner
  - add decorators
  - add generators if need be
  - reduce reliance on system threads
  - more test code using decorators
  - write native python code
- refactor to pypy code (with jit)
  - import imaplib (pure cpython)
  - import pyfuse (cpython wrapper for C lib)
  - probably need to rewrite system threads
- speed test (pypy-jit vs. cpython)
- refactor to pypy-stackless code
  - remove threads, introduce green threads
  - refactor to asynch sockets using green threads (possible?)
- write sikuli script to create test accounts on gmail

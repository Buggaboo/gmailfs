Scratching an itch again. Primary goal: make gmailfs work on any generic 
linux (fuse) / windows (dokan) installation on any imap-based host. 
Maybe port gmailfs to pypy-stackless and hoping to import imaplib (pure 
python lib) and fuse-python (python wrapper around C lib). Leverage 
green threads for escaping locks. Secondary goal: port to dokan library 
in windows. Write tests, write a lot of tests. Write tests for cpython 
variant with threads, pypy-stackless, pypy-jit.

Since I'm going to use pypy; no generators allowed for iterator object 
creation, I hope I can keep decorators.

HOWTO

As root:
> cat user_allow_other >> /etc/fuse.conf

As normal user:
> mkdir -p ~/mnt/gmailfs
> python gmailfs.py -o allow_root -d ~/mnt/gmailfs # -d for debug

Gmailfs requires ext4(?) with extended attributes (xattr) etc. Not sure 
though, waiting for Dave's e-mail response. It's partially working on my 
rig, I have reiserfs (aka murderfs) and no extended attributes.

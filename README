Scratching an itch again. Primary goal: make gmailfs work on any generic 
linux (fuse) / windows (dokan) installation on any imap-based host. 

Maybe port gmailfs to pypy-stackless and hoping to import imaplib (pure 
python lib) and fuse-python (python wrapper around C lib). Leverage 
green threads for escaping locks. Secondary goal: port to dokan library 
in windows. Write tests, write a lot of tests. Write tests for cpython 
variant with threads, pypy-stackless, pypy-jit.

Since I'm going to use pypy; no generators are allowed for iterator 
object creation, I hope I can keep decorators.

HOWTO 10-08-2010

As root:
> grep -n '/home' /etc/fstab # if your home is mounted seperately
> nano +linenr /etc/fstab # add user_xattr for extended attributes 
> apt-getorwhatevereasy-install fuse
> modprobe fuse
> easy-install fuse-python
> cat user_allow_other >> /etc/fuse.conf (if not yet present)

As normal user:
> git clone thisrepository
> cp gmailfs/conf/gmailfs.conf ~/.gmail.conf # adapt to own info
> chmod 600 ~/.gmail.conf
> mkdir -p ~/mnt/gmailfs
> python gmailfs.py -o allow_root -d ~/mnt/gmailfs # -d for debug
> fusermount -u ~/mnt/gmailfs # unmount

WARNING: google reserves the right to revoke your login to gmail, so 
don't test on your personal e-mail address!

Gmailfs requires ext4(?) with extended attributes (xattr). Not sure 
though, waiting for Dave's e-mail response. It's partially working on my 
rig, I have reiserfs (aka murderfs) and no extended attributes (yet).

RESULTS 10-08-2010

With reiserfs with no extended attributes it works like this:

In the gmail web interface, under the label "linux_fs_4":

* Each file crud (creation, update, delete) results in a new e-mail;
* The subject of the e-mails have inode stuff (gibberish to me);
* when the gmailfs mounted files have any content, those are stored as
"noname" attachments. With the original input.

# put this in a script
#!/bin/sh
kill $(ps axf | egrep "python.*gmailfs" | grep -v 'grep' | sed 's/^ \([0-9]\+\).*$/\1/')

#!/bin/sh
set -e -x
grep -n user_allow_other /etc/fuse.conf
mkdir -p ~/mnt/gmailfs-jasm
python src/gmailfs.py -o allow_root -d 9 /home/jasm/mnt/gmailfs-jasm/ | tee -a log.txt

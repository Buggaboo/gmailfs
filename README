Scratching an itch again. Primary goal: port gmailfs to pypy-stackless 
and hoping to import imaplib (pure python lib) and pyfuse (python 
wrapper around C lib). Leverage green threads for escaping locks. 
Secondary goal: port to dokan library in windows. Write tests, write a 
lot of tests. Write tests for cpython variant with threads, 
pypy-stackless, pypy-jit.

Since I'm going to use pypy; no generators allowed for iterator object 
creation, I hope I can keep decorators.
